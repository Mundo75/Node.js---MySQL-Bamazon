# Node.js---MySQL-Bamazon

This bootcamp application, like the name indicates, requires the use of MySQL and Node.js to code 3 console applications to simulate an inventory control system.  The overall application uses MySQL, Inquirer, and console.table NPM packages as the dependencies.  The first Application uses a MySQL database that was pre-built as part of the assignment instructions.  Once built, the coded "Customer" Application employs Inquirer to create a simple user interface in the console to gather and manipulate the user inputs.  From the Console the user can elect to purchase any of the items in the database, providing there is enough in stock to fill the order.  The database inventory is updated after each purchase, as is the sales activity.  The second app is the "Manager" app which again using Inquirer gives the user options to view the inventory,view items that are low inventory, add items to the inventory and add new products. This view is also updated by purchases made through the customer app.  The final app is the "supervisor" app which has2 functions for the user.  The user can view the sales performance by department or and a new sales department.
